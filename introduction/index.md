## Introduction

A modern and framework agnostic authorization and authentication package featuring roles, permissions, custom hashing algorithms and additional security features.

The package follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code.

The package requires PHP 5.4+ and comes bundled with a Laravel 5 Facade and a Service Provider to simplify the optional framework integration.

Have a [read through the Installation Guide](#installation) and on how to [Integrate it with Laravel 5](#laravel-5).

###### Create a user

```php
Sentinel::register(array(
	'email'    => 'john.doe@example.com',
	'password' => 'foobar',
));
```

###### Authenticate a user

```php
Sentinel::authenticate(array(
	'email'    => 'john.doe@example.com',
	'password' => 'foobar',
));
```
