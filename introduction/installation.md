## Installation

The best and easiest way to install Sentinel is with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

If you have [installed Composer globally](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally) run the following:

```
composer require cartalyst/sentinel "2.0.*"
```

Otherwise you'll have to manually download the `composer.phar` file:

```
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar require cartalyst/sentinel "2.0.*"
```

Now you are able to require the `vendor/autoload.php` file to autoload the package.
