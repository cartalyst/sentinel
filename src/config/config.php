    | Throttling
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here, you may configure your site's throttling settings. There are three
    | types of throttling.
    |
    | The first type is "global". Global throttling will monitor the overall
    | failed login attempts across your site and can limit the effects of an
    | attempted DDoS attack.
    |
    | The second type is "ip". This allows you to throttle the failed login
    | attempts (across any account) of a given IP address.
    |
    | The third type is "user". This allows you to throttle the login attempts
    | on an individual user account.
    |
    | Each type of throttling has the same options. The first is the interval.
    | This is the time (in seconds) for which we check for failed logins. Any
    | logins outside this time are no longer assessed when throttling.
    |
    | The second option is thresholds. This may be approached one of two ways.
    | the first way, is by providing an key/value array. The key is the number
    | of failed login attempts, and the value is the delay, in seconds, before
    | the next attempt can occur.
    |
    | The second way is by providing an integer. If the number of failed login
    | attempts outweigh the thresholds integer, that throttle is locked until
    | there are no more failed login attempts within the specified interval.
    |
    | On this premise, we encourage you to use array thresholds for global
    | throttling (and perhaps IP throttling as well), so as to not lock your
    | whole site out for minutes on end because it's being DDoS'd. However,
    | for user throttling, locking a single account out because somebody is
    | attempting to breach it could be an appropriate response.
    |
    | You may use any type of throttling for any scenario, and the specific
    | configurations are designed to be customized as your site grows.
